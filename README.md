<p><h3><b><u>Data Structures & Algorithm Basic Concepts</u></b></h3></p>

<p><b>A data structure</b> is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures. </p>

<p><b><h3>Classification of Data Structure:</h3> </b></p>

<h3>Types of Data structures</h3>
<p><ul><li>Linear data structure</li>
       <li>Non-Linear Data structure</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b><h3></h3>Linear data structure:</b></h3> Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.</p> 
<b>Examples of linear data structures</b> are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
<p> 1. Static data structure: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure.</p>
An example of this data structure is an array.
<p> 2. Dynamic data structure: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code.Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc. </p>


<p><b><h3>Non-linear data structure:</h3></b> Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the elements in a single run only. </p>

<p><b>Data Definition.</b></p>
<p><b>Data Definition defines a particular data with the following characteristics.</b></p>
<p><ul><li><b>Atomic −</b> Definition should define a single concept.</li>
       <li><b>Traceable −</b> Definition should be able to be mapped to some data element.</li>
       <li><b>Accurate −</b> Definition should be unambiguous.</li>
       <li><b>Clear and Concise −</b> Definition should be understandable.</li></ul></p>
       
<p><b><h3>Data Object</h3></b></p>
<p>Data Object represents an object having a data.</p>

<p><b><h3>Data Type</h3></b></p>
<p>Data type is a way to classify various types of data such as integer, string, etc. which determines the values that can be used with the corresponding type of data, the type of operations that can be performed on the corresponding type of data. There are two data types −</p>
<p><ul><li><b>Built-in Data Type</b></li>
       <li><b>Derived Data Type</b></li>
</ul></p>

<p><b><h3>Built-in Data Type</h3></b></p>
<p>Those data types for which a language has built-in support are known as Built-in Data types. For example, most of the languages provide the following built-in data types.</p>
<p><ul><li>Integers</li>
       <li>Boolean (true, false)</li>
       <li>Floating (Decimal numbers)</li>
       <li>Character and Strings</li></ul>
</p>

<p><b><h3>Derived Data Type</h3></b></p>
<p>Those data types which are implementation independent as they can be implemented in one or the other way are known as derived data types. These data types are normally built by the combination of primary or built-in data types and associated operations on them</p>
<p><ul><li>List</li>
       <li>Array</li>
       <li>Stack</li>
       <li>Queue</li></ul>
</p>
